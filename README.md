# conslog - console.log() wrapper

_Conslog_ is a VSCode snippet that wraps a `console.log()` around selected text. Only the part of the selection until the first semicolon is getting wrapped up, the rest remains as is.

The snippet was created to make it easier to log the test cases that are sometimes provided for coding problems.
