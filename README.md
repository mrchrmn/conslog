# conslog - console.log() wrapper

_Conslog_ is a VSCode snippet that wraps a `console.log()` around selected text. Only the part of the selection until the first semicolon is getting wrapped up, the rest remains as is.

Comes with _Alt-Shift-C_ keyboard shortcut.

## Known Issues

Does not work across multiple lines. You would have to use multiple cursors instead.
